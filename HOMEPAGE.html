<h1>WELCOME TO THINKING BEYOND THE FUTURE-NATURE </h1>


<h2><span><strong>Who Are We</strong></span></h2>


<p class="paragraphs"> Thinking Beyond the Future - Nature is a program
intended to help<br> educate people on the importance of conserving 
the environment.<br>We hope that our audience applies the directions we give from 
their places, <br>and finally, we'll have achieved our goal. </p>

<h2><span>Why Save The Earth</span></h2>
<p class="paragraphs">With the rising of the costs of living, man has had to come up with ways of developing himself 
and trying to survive<br> as the world eveolves. Little did he know that he was the main 
cause of the problem.<br> Any opportunity that could take him from poverty to a wealthy life, he embraced with both
arms without considering the outcomes, and, sometimes when he knew the consequences, he still 
ignored and pursued his<br> selfish goals. Unfortunately, things got out of hand and when he realised, it was almost
late.<br><br>

Saving the earth is now the only solution to mans problem and this can only be done
when the earths previous <br>image is restored. To make it simpler, we mean reaforesting everywhere where man deforested
create room for his industries and buildings.</p>
